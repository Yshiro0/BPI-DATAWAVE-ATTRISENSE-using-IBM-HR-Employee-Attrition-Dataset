# BPI-DATAWAVE-ATTRISENSE-using-IBM-HR-Employee-Attrition-Dataset 
AttriSense is an HR analytics tool that predicts employee attrition, visualizes key insights, and provides data-driven solutions to help organizations improve retention and workforce satisfaction. (Made by team The Owlgorithms)
## Quick Start

### 1) Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 (PowerShell)
- Python 3.10–3.13 (recommend 3.11+)

### 2) Setup
Run these in PowerShell, one line at a time:

```
cd "C:\Users\Yohannez Solo\Downloads\ibm_hr_analytics_project"
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3) Required Data
Place `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv` in the project root.

### 4) Train Models
This creates the best model used by the dashboard and saves reports under `submissions/`:

```
python hr_competition_trainer.py
```

Key outputs:
- `submissions/hr_best_model.pkl`
- `submissions/hr_model_performance.csv`
- `submissions/hr_predictions.csv`

If you see scikit-learn InconsistentVersionWarning, it’s safe to ignore. To eliminate it, retrain with your current environment (the command above).

### 5) Run the Dashboard (Simplified)

```
streamlit run streamlit_dashboard_simple.py
```

Open the Local URL shown (e.g., `http://localhost:8501` or `http://localhost:8502`). In the sidebar, pick "🔮 Predictions", set inputs, and click "Predict Attrition Risk". Results appear in the output box.

New buttons available in the simplified app:
- **Upload CSV**: Load a custom dataset for preview and predictions.
- **Predict Attrition Risk**: Run a single-employee prediction.

### 6) Run the Full Dashboard (Optional)

```
streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py
```

Use the page selector to navigate between Dashboard, Predictions, Analytics, and Reports.

Excel reporting and additional actions in the full dashboard:
- **Upload CSV** (sidebar): Load a dataset to enable reporting and batch predictions.
- **Generate Excel report** (Dashboard): Builds a multi-sheet Excel report with inputs and predictions.
- **Download ATTRISEnse Report (.xlsx)**: Download the generated report once ready.

### 7) Tips and Troubleshooting
- PowerShell: don’t chain with `&&`. Run commands on separate lines.
- If predictions hang or fail:
  - Ensure `submissions/hr_best_model.pkl` exists (retrain if missing)
  - Ensure `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv` is present
  - Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+F5) and try again
- First prediction may take ~1–2 seconds (preprocessors fit). Subsequent predictions are typically < 1 second.

## 📦 Excel Reports and New UI Buttons

### Excel Report Generation
- From the full dashboard (`streamlit_dashboard.py`), go to the "📊 Dashboard" page.
- Ensure a dataset is loaded via **Upload CSV** in the sidebar.
- Click **Generate Excel report**. When complete, use **Download ATTRISEnse Report (.xlsx)** to save it.
- The report includes your uploaded data and model predictions.

### New Buttons and Actions
- **Upload CSV**: Import a `.csv` dataset directly in the sidebar.
- **Predict Attrition Risk**: Run an individual prediction in the "🔮 Predictions" page.
- **Generate Excel report**: Create a comprehensive Excel report from the loaded dataset.
- **Download ATTRISEnse Report (.xlsx)**: Download the generated report.
- **Page selector**: Switch between "📊 Dashboard", "🔮 Predictions", "📈 Analytics", and "📋 Reports".

## 🔧 Key Components

### HR Competition Trainer (`hr_competition_trainer.py`)

**Specialized Features:**
- **HR Dataset Loading**: Direct integration with IBM HR dataset
- **Attrition Prediction**: Optimized for employee turnover prediction
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Special techniques for imbalanced attrition data
- **HR-Specific Metrics**: Focus on recall for identifying at-risk employees
- **Feature Engineering**: HR domain-specific preprocessing

**Algorithms Optimized for HR:**
- **Random Forest**: With class balancing for imbalanced data
- **XGBoost**: With scale_pos_weight for attrition prediction
- **LightGBM**: With balanced class weights
- **CatBoost**: With class weights for minority class
- **Logistic Regression**: With balanced class weights
- **HR Ensemble**: Voting classifier combining top models

## 📊 HR-Specific Metrics

The HR competition uses a specialized scoring system:

```
HR Competition Score = (ROC_AUC × 0.3) + (F1_Score × 0.3) + (Recall × 0.4)
```

**Why focus on Recall?**
- **Business Impact**: Missing an employee who will leave (false negative) is more costly than incorrectly flagging someone (false positive)
- **Retention Strategy**: Better to identify more potential leavers and implement retention strategies
- **Cost-Benefit**: False positives are cheaper than false negatives in HR context

## 🎯 HR Competition Strategy

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Target Encoding**: Convert Yes/No to 1/0 for attrition
- **Missing Values**: Median imputation for numerical, mode for categorical
- **Categorical Encoding**: Label encoding for all categorical variables
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler for numerical features
- **Class Balancing**: Special handling for imbalanced attrition data

### 2. Model Selection
- **Baseline**: Logistic Regression with balanced weights
- **Tree-based**: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost with class balancing
- **Ensemble**: Voting classifier with top 3 models
- **Optimization**: Focus on recall and ROC AUC

### 3. Feature Importance
- **HR Domain Knowledge**: Understanding which factors drive attrition
- **Business Insights**: Identifying actionable retention strategies
- **Model Interpretability**: Clear feature importance for HR decisions

### 4. Evaluation Strategy
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold stratified CV
- **Holdout set**: 20% for final evaluation
- **Multiple metrics**: ROC AUC, F1, Precision, Recall
- **Business Focus**: Emphasis on recall for retention strategies

## 📈 HR-Specific Features

### Class Imbalance Handling
The HR dataset has ~16% attrition rate, requiring special handling:

```python
# XGBoost with class balancing
xgb_model = XGBClassifier(
    scale_pos_weight=3,  # Handle class imbalance
    random_state=42
)

# Random Forest with balanced weights
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(
    class_weight='balanced',
    random_state=42
)
```

### HR-Specific Scoring
```python
# HR scoring emphasizes recall
hr_score = (roc_auc * 0.3) + (f1_score * 0.3) + (recall * 0.4)
```

### Feature Importance Analysis
- Automatic identification of key attrition factors
- Business insights for retention strategies
- Actionable recommendations for HR teams

## 🛠️ HR Customization

### Adding HR-Specific Features
```python
# In hr_competition_trainer.py
def create_hr_features(self, data):
    # Add HR-specific feature engineering
    data['tenure_ratio'] = data['YearsAtCompany'] / data['Age']
    data['promotion_rate'] = data['YearsSinceLastPromotion'] / data['YearsAtCompany']
    return data
```
